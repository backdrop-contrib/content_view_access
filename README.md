Content View Access
===================

Provides "View own content" and "View any content" permissions for each content type so they can be configured on the permissions page.

Once enabled you will need to rebuild the node access permissions table, and configure the view permissions for each content type on your website. This is in addition to the global "View published content" permission being enabled. Even if "View published content" is enabled for a role, they will be rejected from viewing content types where they haven't been given the per content type permission that this module provides.
